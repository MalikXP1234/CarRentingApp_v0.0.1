# Guide to my app

This project was one of my first uni course work which needed me to create a website that allows you to hire cars and put them into your place. The main part of the exam is to use Jinja, python and html to create an amazing website. Making sure not to repeat the same code and have functionality.

This base program uses jinja which allows you to create effective website efficiently. All you would need to do. Open up the program and start in the Render_all_py which you will need to download the required extensions such as jinja or python then go to the Sites file and open up on of the html file, now you can see a well-designed app.

Look in the templates Folder for the Raw code files that has the html, jinja and python

My plan is to make this app very effective into doing a lot more with vehicles making them interested for people who are looking into renting a car. :D
